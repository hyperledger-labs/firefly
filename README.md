# FireFly is now a Hyperledger Project! ðŸŽ‰
FireFly has moved out of labs and is now an official Hyperledger Project. The new repo can be found here:

## Update your Git remote
If you need to update your local Git remote to point to the new repo, run these two commands in your local repo:

```
git remote rm origin                                        
git remote add origin git@github.com:hyperledger/firefly.git
```
